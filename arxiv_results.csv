Loyalty Programs in the Sharing Economy: Optimality and Competition,"Zhixuan Fang, Longbo Huang, Adam Wierman",2018-05-09T15:16:50Z,2018-05-09T15:16:50Z,"Loyalty programs are important tools for sharing platforms seeking to grow
supply. Online sharing platforms use loyalty programs to heavily subsidize
resource providers, encouraging participation and boosting supply. As the
sharing economy has evolved and competition has increased, the design of
loyalty programs has begun to play a crucial role in the pursuit of maximal
revenue. In this paper, we first characterize the optimal loyalty program for a
platform with homogeneous users. We then show that optimal revenue in a
heterogeneous market can be achieved by a class of multi-threshold loyalty
program (MTLP) which admits a simple implementation-friendly structure. We also
study the performance of loyalty programs in a setting with two competing
sharing platforms, showing that the degree of heterogeneity is a crucial factor
for both loyalty programs and pricing strategies. Our results show that
sophisticated loyalty programs that reward suppliers via stepwise linear
functions outperform simple sign-up bonuses, which give them a one time reward
for participating.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03581v1,1805.03581v1,['cs.GT'],,,
Privacy-preserving Loyalty Programs,"Alberto Blanco-Justicia, Josep Domingo-Ferrer",2014-11-14T16:32:44Z,2014-12-01T16:25:19Z,"Loyalty programs are promoted by vendors to incentivize loyalty in buyers.
Although such programs have become widespread, they have been criticized by
business experts and consumer associations: loyalty results in profiling and
hence in loss of privacy of consumers. We propose a protocol for
privacy-preserving loyalty programs that allows vendors and consumers to enjoy
the benefits of loyalty (returning customers and discounts, respectively),
while allowing consumers to stay anonymous and empowering them to decide how
much of their profile they reveal to the vendor. The vendor must offer
additional reward if he wants to learn more details on the consumer's profile.
Our protocol is based on partially blind signatures and generalization
techniques, and provides anonymity to consumers and their purchases, while
still allowing negotiated consumer profiling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.3961v2,1411.3961v2,['cs.CR'],,,"Presented at the 9th DPM International Workshop on Data Privacy

Fast Privacy-Preserving Punch Cards,Saba Eskandarian,2020-06-10T21:49:15Z,2021-02-19T17:40:52Z,"Loyalty programs in the form of punch cards that can be redeemed for benefits
have long been a ubiquitous element of the consumer landscape. However, their
increasingly popular digital equivalents, while providing more convenience and
better bookkeeping, pose a considerable privacy risk. This paper introduces a
privacy-preserving punch card protocol that allows firms to digitize their
loyalty programs without forcing customers to submit to corporate surveillance.
We also present a number of extensions that allow our scheme to provide other
privacy-preserving customer loyalty features.
  Compared to the best prior work, we achieve a $14\times$ reduction in the
computation and a $11\times$ reduction in the communication required to perform
a ""hole punch,"" a $55\times$ reduction in the communication required to redeem
a punch card, and a $128\times$ reduction in the computation time required to
redeem a card. Much of our performance improvement can be attributed to
removing the reliance on pairings or range proofs present in prior work, which
has only addressed this problem in the context of more general loyalty systems.
By tailoring our scheme to punch cards and related loyalty systems, we
demonstrate that we can reduce communication and computation costs by orders of
magnitude.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06079v3,2006.06079v3,['cs.CR'],,,
"The shape of the relative frailty variance induced by discrete random
  effect distributions in univariate and multivariate survival models","Maximilian Bardo, Steffen Unkel",2023-03-08T22:11:45Z,2023-03-08T22:11:45Z,"In statistical models for the analysis of time-to-event data, individual
heterogeneity is usually accounted for by means of one or more random effects,
also known as frailties. In the vast majority of the literature, the random
effect is assumed to follow a continuous probability distribution. However, in
some areas of application, a discrete frailty distribution may be more
appropriate. We investigate and compare various existing families of discrete
univariate and shared frailty models by taking as our focus the variance of the
relative frailty distribution in survivors. The relative frailty variance (RFV)
among survivors provides a readily interpretable measure of how the
heterogeneity of a population, as represented by a frailty model, evolves over
time. We explore the shape of the RFV for the purpose of model selection and
review available discrete random effect distributions in this context. We find
non-monotone trajectories of the RFV for discrete univariate and shared frailty
models, which is a rare property. Furthermore, we proof that for discrete
time-invariant univariate and shared frailty models with (without) an atom at
zero, the limit of the RFV approaches infinity (zero), if the support of the
discrete distribution can be arranged in ascending order. Through the
one-to-one relationship of the RFV with the cross-ratio function in shared
frailty models, which we generalize to the higher-variate case, our results
also apply to patterns of association within a cluster. Extensions and
contrasts to discrete time-varying frailty models and contrasts to correlated
discrete frailty models are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04915v1,2303.04915v1,"['stat.ME', '62N99, 62H20', 'G.3']",,,"25 pages, 2 figures, 1 table"
How Many Customers Does a Retail Store Have?,"Ondřej Sokol, Vladimír Holý",2019-04-23T08:36:02Z,2020-04-05T19:00:17Z,"The knowledge of the number of customers is the pillar of retail business
analytics. In our setting, we assume that a portion of customers is monitored
and easily counted due to the loyalty program while the rest is not monitored.
The behavior of customers in both groups may significantly differ making the
estimation of the number of unmonitored customers a non-trivial task. We
identify shopping patterns of several customer segments which allows us to
estimate the distribution of customers without the loyalty card using the
maximum likelihood method. In a simulation study, we find that the proposed
approach is quite precise even when the data sample is very small and its
assumptions are violated to a certain degree. In an empirical study of a
drugstore chain, we validate and illustrate the proposed approach in practice.
The actual number of customers estimated by the proposed method is much higher
than the number suggested by the naive estimate assuming the constant customer
distribution. The proposed method can also be utilized to determine penetration
of the loyalty program in the individual customer segments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10199v2,1904.10199v2,['stat.AP'],,,
"Frozen propagation of Reynolds force vector from high-fidelity data into
  Reynolds-averaged simulations of secondary flows","Ali Amarloo, Pourya Forooghi, Mahdi Abkar",2022-09-08T16:45:31Z,2022-10-08T09:52:12Z,"Successful propagation of information from high-fidelity sources (i.e.,
direct numerical simulations and large-eddy simulations) into Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations plays an important role in the emerging field of
data-driven RANS modeling. Small errors carried in high-fidelity data can
propagate amplified errors into the mean flow field, and higher Reynolds
numbers worsen the error propagation. In this study, we compare a series of
propagation methods for two cases of Prandtl's secondary flows of the second
kind: square-duct flow at a low Reynolds number and roughness-induced secondary
flow at a very high Reynolds number. We show that frozen treatments result in
less error propagation than the implicit treatment of Reynolds stress tensor
(RST), and for cases with very high Reynolds numbers, explicit and implicit
treatments are not recommended. Inspired by the obtained results, we introduce
the frozen treatment to the propagation of Reynolds force vector (RFV), which
leads to less error propagation. Specifically, for both cases at low and high
Reynolds numbers, propagation of RFV results in one order of magnitude lower
error compared to RST propagation. In the frozen treatment method, three
different eddy-viscosity models are used to evaluate the effect of turbulent
diffusion on error propagation. We show that, regardless of the baseline model,
the frozen treatment of RFV results in less error propagation. We combined one
extra correction term for turbulent kinetic energy with the frozen treatment of
RFV, which makes our propagation technique capable of reproducing both velocity
and turbulent kinetic energy fields similar to high-fidelity data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03911v2,2209.03911v2,['physics.flu-dyn'],10.1063/5.0123231,,
"Price Discrimination in the Presence of Customer Loyalty and Differing
  Firm Costs","Theja Tulabandhula, Aris Ouksel, Son Nguyen",2021-02-16T23:34:29Z,2022-01-22T21:10:57Z,"We study how loyalty behavior of customers and differing costs to produce
undifferentiated products by firms can influence market outcomes. In prior
works that study such markets, firm costs have generally been assumed
negligible or equal, and loyalty is modeled as an additive bias in customer
valuations. We extend these previous treatments by explicitly considering cost
asymmetry and richer customer loyalty behavior in a game-theoretic model. Thus,
in the setting where firms incur different non-negligible product costs, and
customers have firm-specific loyalty levels, we comprehensively characterize
the effects of loyalty and product cost difference on market outcomes such as
prices, market shares, and profits. Our analysis and numerical simulations
provide new insights into how firms can price, how they can survive competition
even with higher product costs, and how they can control these costs and/or
increase customer loyalty to change their market position.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09620v2,2102.09620v2,"['econ.TH', 'math.OC']",,,"82 pages, 12 figures"

customer advocacy and propensity for cross buying. The findings highlight the
importance of nurturing customer loyalty through valuable and relevant

Loyalty in Online Communities,"William L. Hamilton, Justine Zhang, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Dan Jurafsky, Jure Leskovec",2017-03-09T18:37:50Z,2017-05-24T14:45:13Z,"Loyalty is an essential component of multi-community engagement. When users
have the choice to engage with a variety of different communities, they often
become loyal to just one, focusing on that community at the expense of others.
However, it is unclear how loyalty is manifested in user behavior, or whether
loyalty is encouraged by certain community characteristics.
  In this paper we operationalize loyalty as a user-community relation: users
loyal to a community consistently prefer it over all others; loyal communities
retain their loyal users over time. By exploring this relation using a large
dataset of discussion communities from Reddit, we reveal that loyalty is
manifested in remarkably consistent behaviors across a wide spectrum of
communities. Loyal users employ language that signals collective identity and
engage with more esoteric, less popular content, indicating they may play a
curational role in surfacing new material. Loyal communities have denser
user-user interaction networks and lower rates of triadic closure, suggesting
that community-level loyalty is associated with more cohesive interactions and
less fragmentation into subgroups. We exploit these general patterns to predict
future rates of loyalty. Our results show that a user's propensity to become
loyal is apparent from their first interactions with a community, suggesting
that some users are intrinsically loyal from the very beginning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03386v3,1703.03386v3,"['cs.SI', 'cs.CL']",,,"Extended version of a paper appearing in the Proceedings of ICWSM

Phenomenological consequences of radiative flavor violation in the MSSM,"Andreas Crivellin, Lars Hofer, Ulrich Nierste, Dominik Scherer",2011-05-13T19:57:16Z,2011-12-06T23:36:19Z,"In this article we investigate the consequences of radiative flavor violation
(RFV) in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). In this framework
the small off-diagonal elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix
and the small quark masses of the first two generations are generated from the
trilinear supersymmetry-breaking terms. The impact of RFV on flavor-physics
observables is studied in detail. We focus on the limiting cases in which the
CKM matrix is either generated in the down-sector, i.e. by the soft
SUSY-breaking mass insertions delta^dLR_i3 (i=1,2), or in the up-quark sector,
i.e. by the mass insertions delta^uLR_i3. In the first case we find an
enhancement of b->s gamma, which constrains the allowed range of sparticle
masses (Fig. 3). In addition, neutral Higgs penguins significantly contribute
to B_s,d->mu^+mu^- and, if also delta^dLR_32 is different from zero, these
Higgs effects are capable of explaining the observed CP phase in the B_s
system. If, on the other hand, the CKM generation takes place in the up-sector,
|epsilon_K| receives additional positive contributions enforcing large squark
and gluino masses (see Fig. 8). In this case also the rare decay K->pi nu nu
receives sizable contributions. In conclusion we find that for SUSY masses
around 1 TeV RFV is an interesting alternative to Minimal Flavor Violation
(MFV).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.2818v3,1105.2818v3,"['hep-ph', 'hep-ex']",10.1103/PhysRevD.84.035030,,"12 pages, 10 figures, version accepted for publication in PRD, eq.

behavior is one of the most representative topics which can provide valuable

investigated bandwagon dynamics from a long-term perspective. In this work, we
focus on characterizing and predicting long-term bandwagon user behaviors in
the context of online fan loyalty. Using a dataset collected from NBA-related
discussion forums on Reddit, we trace the long-term loyalty status of bandwagon
fans to capture their latent behavioral characteristics and then propose a
computational model to predict their next sport season loyalty status with
their home teams. Our analyses reveal that bandwagoning for most fans is a
temporary switch and most of them will be back in the long term. In addition,
online fans with different loyalty levels to their home teams have demonstrated
different behaviors in various aspects, such as activity level, language usage

E-loyalty networks in online auctions,"Wolfgang Jank, Inbal Yahav",2010-10-08T09:32:37Z,2010-10-08T09:32:37Z,"Creating a loyal customer base is one of the most important, and at the same
time, most difficult tasks a company faces. Creating loyalty online (e-loyalty)
is especially difficult since customers can ``switch'' to a competitor with the
click of a mouse. In this paper we investigate e-loyalty in online auctions.
Using a unique data set of over 30,000 auctions from one of the main
consumer-to-consumer online auction houses, we propose a novel measure of
e-loyalty via the associated network of transactions between bidders and
sellers. Using a bipartite network of bidder and seller nodes, two nodes are
linked when a bidder purchases from a seller and the number of repeat-purchases
determines the strength of that link. We employ ideas from functional principal
component analysis to derive, from this network, the loyalty distribution which
measures the perceived loyalty of every individual seller, and associated
loyalty scores which summarize this distribution in a parsimonious way. We then
investigate the effect of loyalty on the outcome of an auction. In doing so, we
are confronted with several statistical challenges in that standard statistical
models lead to a misrepresentation of the data and a violation of the model
assumptions. The reason is that loyalty networks result in an extreme
clustering of the data, with few high-volume sellers accounting for most of the
individual transactions. We investigate several remedies to the clustering
problem and conclude that loyalty networks consist of very distinct segments
that can best be understood individually.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.1636v1,1010.1636v1,['stat.AP'],10.1214/09-AOAS310,"Annals of Applied Statistics 2010, Vol. 4, No. 1, 151-178","Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-AOAS310 the Annals of

Evolution of Voronoi based Fuzzy Recurrent Controllers,"Carlos Kavka, Patricia Roggero, Marc Schoenauer",2005-11-28T07:14:18Z,2005-11-28T07:14:18Z,"A fuzzy controller is usually designed by formulating the knowledge of a
human expert into a set of linguistic variables and fuzzy rules. Among the most
successful methods to automate the fuzzy controllers development process are
evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we propose the Recurrent Fuzzy Voronoi
(RFV) model, a representation for recurrent fuzzy systems. It is an extension
of the FV model proposed by Kavka and Schoenauer that extends the application
domain to include temporal problems. The FV model is a representation for fuzzy
controllers based on Voronoi diagrams that can represent fuzzy systems with
synergistic rules, fulfilling the $\epsilon$-completeness property and
providing a simple way to introduce a priory knowledge. In the proposed
representation, the temporal relations are embedded by including internal units
that provide feedback by connecting outputs to inputs. These internal units act
as memory elements. In the RFV model, the semantic of the internal units can be
specified together with the a priori rules. The geometric interpretation of the
rules allows the use of geometric variational operators during the evolution.
The representation and the algorithms are validated in two problems in the area
of system identification and evolutionary robotics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0511091v1,cs/0511091v1,['cs.AI'],,Dans GECCO 2005,
